A **service account** provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod.

* When you access the cluster, you are authenticated by the apiserver as a particular User Account. Similarly, Processes in containers inside pods can also contact the apiserver. When they do, they are authenticated as a particular Service Account.
* By default, applications will authenticate as the `default` service account in the namespace they are running in.
* Service accounts are namespaced.
* ServiceAccount Admission Controller ensures that the `serviceAccountName` referenced by the pod exists,and otherwise rejects it.

## ServiceAccount ##
In operator-sdk 1, there is no default serviceaccount provided in the `/config/rbac/` folder. So you need to manually create the ServiceAccount for this operator.

Execute below command to create operator *ServiceAccount*:

```execute
cat <<'EOF'>$HOME/mvc-db-app-operator/config/rbac/service_account.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: mvc-db-app-operator
EOF
```
This ServiceAccount provides the required permissions for the deployment and containers residing inside it.

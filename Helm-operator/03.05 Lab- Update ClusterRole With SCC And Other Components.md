##ClusterRole##

The file `/config/rbac/role.yaml` contains the required permissions for your ClusterRole.

See how your role.yaml looks initially.
```execute
cat $HOME/mvc-db-app-operator/config/rbac/role.yaml
```
Output:
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: manager-role
rules:

## Base operator rules

In order to make the operator work, the following permissions should be added to this file.
* This operator will create certain resources as part of application deployment which requires cluster level permissions on OpenShift. So `securitycontextconstraints(SCC)` of `anyuid` should be provided to the ServiceAccount.
You will have to add the following for this purpose.
```
- apiGroups:
  - "security.openshift.io"
  resourceNames:
  - "anyuid"
  resources:
  - "securitycontextconstraints"
  verbs:
  - "use"
```
* This operator will need permissions for getting `configmaps` under *Core API Group*.So you will have to add the following.
```
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - configmaps
  verbs:
  - create
  - delete
  - get
  - list
  - patch
  - update
  - watch
```
* You need to set `finalizers` for the Custom Resource Object. So you will need to add the following. 
```
- apiGroups:
  - example.com
  resources:
  - mvcdbs
  - mvcdbs/status
  - mvcdbs/finalizers
  verbs:
  - create
  - delete
  - get
  - list
  - patch
  - update
  - watch
```
* You need to provide all required verbs to access the CRD resource. So you will have to add the following.
```
- apiGroups:
  - apiextensions.k8s.io
  resources:
  - customresourcedefinitions
  verbs:
  - create
  - delete
  - get
  - list
  - patch
  - update
  - watch
```
So you can remove the initial file and replace it with the provided file.

Execute the below command to remove it.
```execute
rm -f $HOME/mvc-db-app-operator/config/rbac/role.yaml
```
And create the same file with all required changes
```execute
cat <<'EOF'>$HOME/mvc-db-app-operator/config/rbac/role.yaml

##ClusterRoleBinding##

Now you need to modify the `role_binding.yaml` file to bind the ClusterRole, so that the ServiceAccount can have all required permissions to deploy the operator.
Let's have a look at your initial role_binding.yaml.
```execute
cat $HOME/mvc-db-app-operator/config/rbac/role_binding.yaml
```
Output:
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: manager-rolebinding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: manager-role
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: system
```
* As you need to provide permission to the manually created service account earlier, you will change the name to `mvc-db-app-operator`.
* In this lab you will deploy the operator using `make` command(Will see in later section).From observation it seems that this command by default deploys the operator in a namespace:`<directory-name>-system`. So in this case the namespace will be `mvc-db-app-operator-system`. So you need to replace the namespace with this value.

Execute the below command to remove it.
```execute
rm -f $HOME/mvc-db-app-operator/config/rbac/role_binding.yaml
```
And create the same file with required variables
```execute
cat <<'EOF'>$HOME/mvc-db-app-operator/config/rbac/role_binding.yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: manager-rolebinding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: manager-role
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: mvc-db-app-operator
  namespace: mvc-db-app-operator-system
EOF
```
Now you are all set to move to the next section.

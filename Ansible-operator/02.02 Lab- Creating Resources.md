Let's start by creating the role. You will need to add the code related to resources which you want to deploy in the `main.yml` of the `tasks` folder. You will need a **Deployment** to deploy the flask-app and a **Service** to access the application.


To add the code to `main.yml` of `tasks` folder.
```execute
cat << EOF > roles/flask/tasks/main.yml
---
# tasks file for Flask
- name: start flask deployment ansible
  k8s:
    definition:
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        name: flask-deployment
        namespace: '{{ ansible_operator_meta.namespace }}'
      spec:
        serviceAccountName: flask-operator
        serviceAccount: flask-operator
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: flask-ansible
        replicas: "{{ replicaCount }}"
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: flask-ansible
          spec:
            containers:
            - name: flask
              image: "{{ image }}"
              ports:
              - containerPort: "{{ port }}"

- name: start flask service ansible
  k8s:
    definition:
      kind: Service
      apiVersion: v1
      metadata:
        name: flask-deployment-service
        namespace: '{{ ansible_operator_meta.namespace }}'
      spec:
        selector:
          app: flask-ansible
        ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: "{{ servicePort }}"
          targetPort: "{{ port }}"          
        type: "{{ serviceType }}"
EOF
```
To check the content of `main.yml` :
```execute
cat roles/flask/tasks/main.yml
```
Output should look like :
```
---
# tasks file for Flask
- name: start flask deployment ansible
  k8s:
    definition:
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        name: flask-deployment
        namespace: '{{ ansible_operator_meta.namespace }}'
      spec:
        serviceAccountName: flask-operator
        serviceAccount: flask-operator
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: flask-ansible
        replicas: "{{ replicaCount }}"
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: flask-ansible
          spec:
            containers:
            - name: flask
              image: "{{ image }}"
              ports:
              - containerPort: "{{ port }}"

- name: start flask service ansible
  k8s:
    definition:
      kind: Service
      apiVersion: v1
      metadata:
        name: flask-deployment-service
        namespace: '{{ ansible_operator_meta.namespace }}'
      spec:
        selector:
          app: flask-ansible
        ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: "{{ servicePort }}"
          targetPort: "{{ port }}"          
        type: "{{ serviceType }}"
```
Let's breakdown this file and understand what it means.

* `- name` : This is just a brief description of what a task does.

* `k8s` : The task is using `k8s` module for its execution. `k8s` module is discussed in the **Ansible** lab. It is used to define a Kubernetes resource.

* `definition` : The definition of the resource begins here.

Following this, there is a standard definition of a `Deployment` and a `Service` resource. There are two things to notice in the `Deployment` definition :

* `replicas` : In the `spec` section, value of `replicas` is `"{{ replicaCount }}"`. This `replicaCount` is passed from the CR definition to Ansible and it is accessible over here using the Jinja2-templating i.e. the double open-close curly braces. Here `replicaCount` specifies the number of deployments you want.

* `image` : In the `spec` section, value of `image` is `"{{ image }}"`. This `image` is passed from the CR definition to Ansible and it is accessible over here using the Jinja2-templating i.e. the double open-close curly braces. Here `image` is the image whose deployment you want to create.

Now pass the values for the variables required from `vars/main.yml` file.

```execute
vi roles/flask/vars/main.yml
```
```
---
# vars file for Flask
replicaCount: 2

port: 5000

image: "quay.io/opentestlabs/flask-app:latest"

serviceType: NodePort
servicePort: 8000

```

Now modify the CRD for the operator with the following content removing the default content.

```execute
vi config/crd/bases/example.com_flasks.yaml
```
```
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: flasks.example.com
spec:
  group: example.com
  names:
    kind: Flask
    listKind: FlaskList
    plural: flasks
    singular: flask
  scope: Namespaced
  subresources:
    status: {}
  validation:
    openAPIV3Schema:
      type: object
      x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true
  versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    served: true
    storage: true
```
Now let's modify the patch file for the deployment with the content.
```execute
vi config/default/manager_auth_proxy_patch.yaml
```
```
# This patch inject a sidecar container which is a HTTP proxy for the
# controller manager, it performs RBAC authorization against the Kubernetes API using SubjectAccessReviews.
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flask-operator
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kube-rbac-proxy
        image: registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-kube-rbac-proxy:v4.6.0
        args:
        - "--secure-listen-address=0.0.0.0:8443"
        - "--upstream=http://127.0.0.1:8080/"
        - "--logtostderr=true"
        - "--v=10"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8443
          name: https
      - name: manager
        args:
        - "--metrics-addr=127.0.0.1:8080"
        - "--enable-leader-election"
        - "--leader-election-id=flask-operator"
```
Modify the cluster role and role-binding required for your operator.
In this case, the files will be like the following.
* ClusterRole
```execute
cat config/rbac/role.yaml
```
Output:
```
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: manager-role
rules:

  ## Base operator rules

      - ""
    resources:

      - get
      - list
      - patch
      - update
      - watch
# +kubebuilder:scaffold:rules

```
* ClusterRoleBinding

```execute
cat config/rbac/role_binding.yaml
```
Output:

```
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: manager-rolebinding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: manager-role
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: flask-operator
  namespace: flask-operator-system
```
 
Now that you are done all required resource creation part, let's build your operator image and deploy it.

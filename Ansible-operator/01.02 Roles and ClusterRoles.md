The RBAC `Role` and `ClusterRole` contain rules that represent a set of permissions.

* A **Role** always sets permissions within a particular namespace; while creating a Role,the namespace it belongs in should be specified.
* A **ClusterRole** is a non-namespaced resource. 
* A Kubernetes object always has to be either namespaced or non-namespaced; it can't be both. So we provide permissions to them using either `Role` or `ClusterRole`.

Following are the few important Kubernetes resouces which are **namespaced (for Roles)** or **Non-namespaced (for ClusterRoles)**:

| Namespaced               |Non-Namespaced
| ------------------------ |--------------------------|
| ConfigMap                |Network                   |
| PersistentVolumeClaim    |PersistentVolume          |
| Pod                      |OAuth                     |
| Secret                   |CustomResourceDefinition  |
| ServiceAccount           |Ingress                   |
| Service                  |SecurityContextConstraints|
| Deployment               |Namespace                 |
| ReplicaSet               |Project                   |
| Route                    |StorageClass              |



You can add and modify the permissions provided to these resources based on your requirements.

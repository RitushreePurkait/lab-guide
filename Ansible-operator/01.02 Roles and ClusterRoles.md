The RBAC `Role` and `ClusterRole` contain rules that represent a set of permissions.

* A **Role** always sets permissions within a particular namespace; while creating a Role,the namespace it belongs in should be specified.
* A **ClusterRole** is a non-namespaced resource. 
* A Kubernetes object always has to be either namespaced or non-namespaced; it can't be both. So we provide permissions to them using either `Role` or `ClusterRole`.

Following are the few important Kubernetes resouces which are **namespaced (for Roles)**:
* ConfigMap
* PersistentVolumeClaim
* Pod
* Secret
* ServiceAccount
* Service
* Deployment
* ReplicaSet
* Route

Following are the few important Kubernetes resouces which are **non-namespaced (for RoleBindings)**:

* PersistentVolume
* SecurityContextConstraints
* Ingress
* Network
* OAuth
* CustomResourceDefinition
* Namespace

You can add and modify the permissions provided to these resources based on your requirements.

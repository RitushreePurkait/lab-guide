Let's quickly start creating Ansible Operator from scratch. For creating an operator the **Operator-SDK** tool is used.


To check whether operator-sdk is installed and the various available commands :
```execute
operator-sdk help
```

The output should be :
```
Development kit for building Kubernetes extensions and tools.

Provides libraries and tools to create new projects, APIs and controllers.
Includes tools for packaging artifacts into an installer container.

Typical project lifecycle:

- initialize a project:

  operator-sdk init --domain example.com --license apache2 --owner "The Kubernetes authors"

- create one or more a new resource APIs and add your code to them:

  operator-sdk create api --group <group> --version <version> --kind <Kind>

Create resource will prompt the user for if it should scaffold the Resource and / or Controller. To only
scaffold a Controller for an existing Resource, select "n" for Resource. To only define
the schema for a Resource without writing a Controller, select "n" for Controller.

After the scaffold is written, api will run make on the project.

Usage:
  operator-sdk [flags]
  operator-sdk [command]

Examples:

  # Initialize your project
  operator-sdk init --domain example.com --license apache2 --owner "The Kubernetes authors"

  # Create a frigates API with Group: ship, Version: v1beta1 and Kind: Frigate
  operator-sdk create api --group ship --version v1beta1 --kind Frigate

  # Edit the API Scheme
  nano api/v1beta1/frigate_types.go

  # Edit the Controller
  nano controllers/frigate_controller.go

  # Install CRDs into the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl apply
  make install

  # Regenerate code and run against the Kubernetes cluster configured by ~/.kube/config
  make run


Available Commands:
  bundle      Manage operator bundle metadata
  cleanup     Clean up an Operator deployed with the 'run' subcommand
  completion  Generators for shell completions
  create      Scaffold a Kubernetes API or webhook
  generate    Invokes a specific generator
  help        Help about any command
  init        Initialize a new project
  olm         Manage the Operator Lifecycle Manager installation in your cluster
  run         Run an Operator in a variety of environments
  scorecard   Runs scorecard
  version     Prints the version of operator-sdk

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for operator-sdk
      --verbose   Enable verbose logging

Use "operator-sdk [command] --help" for more information about a command.

```
This means operator-sdk is installed.

**This Lab uses Operator-SDK version v1.1.0. All the commands executed in this course are compatible with the version v1.1.0.**


To check the operator-sdk version execute the below command:

```execute
operator-sdk version
```

Output:

```output
operator-sdk version: "v1.1.0", commit: "9d27e224efac78fcc9354ece4e43a50eb30ea968", kubernetes version: "v1.18.2", go version: "go1.15 linux/amd64", GOOS: "linux", GOARCH: "amd64"
```


For this lab, a demo flask-app image is used for deployment.

Navigate to the home directory. Click on the below command to execute it:

```execute
cd ~
```

Create a working directory for the lab exercise by executing below command:

```execute
mkdir flask-operator
```

Navigate to the working directory by executing the below command:

```execute
cd flask-operator
```

Now to create an operator using the operator-sdk 1 :
```execute
operator-sdk init flask-operator --plugins=ansible --domain=com
```
Output:
```
Next: define a resource with:
$ operator-sdk create api
```
```execute
operator-sdk create api --group example --version v1alpha1 --kind Flask --generate-role
```

Let's understand what these commands means.

* `operator-sdk` : The tool used to create an operator.
* ` init` :  generates the RBAC rules in config/rbac/role.yaml based on the resources that would be deployed by the chart’s default manifest.
* `--plugins` : this allows the SDK to know its building an operator based on ansible
* `--domain` : this is the domain for the api that gets created 
* `--group `: this is the group that will be associated with the created api
* `--version `: this is the version associated with the created api
* `--kind `: This is the kind of CRD(Custom Resource Definition) or in more simple words, the kind of object. It can be any anything. As a Flask application is used for deployment purpose, CRD is named as Flask. This value is also used (in lowercase) to name all the generated operator manifests and helm chart when the project is created.

Let's check its directory structure.
```execute
tree ~/flask-operator/
```
Output should look like :
```

Now let's take a look at some of the important files and directories that are used when deploying an Operator.

**Overview of the files generated in Helm-based operators**

* `config `: Contains kustomize manifests for deploying this operator on a Kubernetes cluster.
CRD manifests are present in **config/crd/bases**
CR manifests are present in **config/samples**
Controller manifest is present in **config/manager/manager.yaml**
RBAC manifests are present in **config/rbac/**
The ServiceMonitor resource for monitoring the operator is in **config/prometheus**
Some sample configurations for testing are present in **config/testing**
* `watches.yaml `: The **Ansible Operator** uses this file to tell the Openshift/Kubernetes which Custom Resource (based on Version,Group,Kind) it will manage. Lets take a look at the file what is contains.
* `Makefile `: Is contains helpful targets for build, test, and deployment, and to give you flexibility to tailor things to your project’s needs
* `PROJECT `: Contains meta information about the project.
* `Dockerfile `: Used to build the operator image with make docker-build. 
* `roles` : A subdirectory for the roles tree to run.
* `requirements.yml`:	A YAML file containing the Ansible collections and role dependencies to 
* `molecule/`	: The Molecule scenarios for end-to-end testing of your role and operator
install during build.
```execute
cat ~/flask-operator/watches.yaml
```
This command should output :
```
---
# Use the 'create api' subcommand to add watches to this file.
- version: v1alpha1
  group: example.com
  kind: Flask
  role: flask
# +kubebuilder:scaffold:watch
```
* `version` : The version of custom resource the operator should manage. You have passed `v1alpha1` to `--api-version` during the operator creation in this case.

* `group` : The group of custom resource the operator should manage. You have passed `example.flask.com` to `--api-version` during the operator creation in this case.

* `kind` : The kind of custom resource the operator should manage. You have used `--kind=Flask` in this case.

* `role` : This is the Ansible role the operator should perform. If there are more than one role, you can also specify a path to playbook instead.

Let's modify the watches.yaml to pass RELATED_IMAGE variables.

```execute
vi ~/flask-operator/watches.yaml
```
This command should output :
```
---
# Use the 'create api' subcommand to add watches to this file.
- version: v1alpha1
  group: example.com
  kind: Flask
  role: flask
  overrideValues:    
    flask.image: $RELATED_IMAGE_FLASK
    vue.image: $RELATED_IMAGE_VUE
# +kubebuilder:scaffold:watch
```


Now that you have got a fair idea of how to create an **Ansible Operator** and what is its directory structure, let's start writing code into various files to get your operator running so that it creates various resources for the flask-app and manage it.

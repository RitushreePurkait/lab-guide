A **service account** provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod.

* When you access the cluster, you are authenticated by the apiserver as a particular User Account. Similarly, Processes in containers inside pods can also contact the apiserver. When they do, they are authenticated as a particular Service Account.
* By default, applications will authenticate as the `default` service account in the namespace they are running in.
* Service accounts are namespaced.
* ServiceAccount Admission Controller ensures that the serviceAccountName referenced by the pod exists,and otherwise rejects it.

For this operator, the most basic requirement is to create a ServiceAccount named `flask-operator`, in your namespace which will be used in all the deployments.
```execute
cat << EOF > ~/flask-operator/service_account.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: flask-operator
  namespace: $YOUR_NAMESPACE
EOF
```
**NOTE :** Replace $YOUR_NAMESPACE with your namespace.
```execute
oc create -f ~/flask-operator/service_account.yaml
```

This ServiceAccount provides the required permissions for the deployment and containers residing inside it.

**Overview of the files generated in Helm-based operators**

`config `: Contains kustomize manifests for deploying this operator on a Kubernetes cluster.
CRD manifests are present in **config/crd/bases**
CR manifests are present in **config/samples**
Controller manifest is present in **config/manager/manager.yaml**
RBAC manifests are present in **config/rbac/**

`helm-charts/ `: Your helm chart that will be triggered for respective CR created for the defined CRD is in helm-charts/ 
`watches.yaml `: Object's definition that watches CR of a particular Group, Kind, Version and states which chart to invoke when an object of mentioned group, kind, version is created is in watches.yaml
`Makefile `: Is contains helpful targets for build, test, and deployment, and to give you flexibility to tailor things to your projectâ€™s needs
`PROJECT `: Contains meta information about the project.
`Dockerfile `: Used to build the operator image with make docker-build.

**Note that the CR spec automatically is populated with key-value from your charts values.yaml.**

## Using a Single Image Variable ##

* Make sure the values.yaml contains only single image variables .

```execute
cat helm-charts/flask-app/values.yaml
```

```
# Default values for flask-app.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

# Variables for Flask Server
flask:
  image: quay.io/rhm_samples/flask-server:v0.0.1
  # To pass image pull secrets (if any)
  imagePullSecrets: []
  replicaCount: 1
  
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
    port: 5000

# Variables for Vue Client
vue:
  image: quay.io/rhm_samples/flask-vue-client:v0.0.1
  # To pass image pull secrets (if any)
  imagePullSecrets: []
  replicaCount: 1
  
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
    port: 8080
```

* We need to edit the watches.yaml file to add the overrideValues: field 

```execute
cat watches.yaml
```

```
# Use the 'create api' subcommand to add watches to this file.
- group: example.com
  version: v1alpha1
  kind: Flask
  chart: helm-charts/flask-app
  overrideValues:    
    flask.image: $RELATED_IMAGE_FLASK
    vue.image: $RELATED_IMAGE_VUE
# +kubebuilder:scaffold:watch
```

**NOTE: Do not remove the +kubebuilder:scaffold:watch marker. It allows the tool to update the watches file when new APIs are created.**

* Before building the ClusterServiceVersion we edit the manager.yaml.(You can replace or edit with the following)

```execute
cat config/manager/manager.yaml
```

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

  name: flask-operator

            - name: RELATED_IMAGE_VUE
              value: quay.io/rhm_samples/flask-vue-client:v0.0.1
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
```



## Dockerfile Requirements ##

* You must configure the required labels (name, vendor, version, release, summary, description)
* Software license(s) must be included within the image.

```execute
vi Dockerfile
```

```
# Build the manager binary

FROM quay.io/operator-framework/helm-operator:v1.1.0

LABEL name="Flask Operator" \
      vendor="IBM Edge" \
      version="v0.0.1" \
      release="1" \
      summary="This is an example of a flask helm operator." \
      description="This operator will deploy flask application to the cluster."

# Required Licenses

COPY licenses /licenses

ENV HOME=/opt/helm
COPY watches.yaml ${HOME}/watches.yaml
COPY helm-charts  ${HOME}/helm-charts
WORKDIR ${HOME}
```

This Dockerfile references a licenses/ directory, which needs to be manually added to the root of the project. This directory must include the software license(s) of your project.

## Update the Controller Manager ##

By default, config/default/manager_auth_proxy_patch.yaml uses an uncertified kubebuilder image. In order to pass certification, it'll need to be changed to the certified image.

Edit the controller manager and replace the image with the certified version, **registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-kube-rbac-proxy:v4.6.0**

```execute
vi config/default/manager_auth_proxy_patch.yaml
```

```
# This patch inject a sidecar container which is a HTTP proxy for the

# controller manager, it performs RBAC authorization against the Kubernetes API using SubjectAccessReviews.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flask-operator
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:

   - name: kube-rbac-proxy
     image: registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-kube-rbac-proxy:v4.6.0
     args:
     - "--secure-listen-address=0.0.0.0:8443"
     - "--upstream=http://127.0.0.1:8080/"
     - "--logtostderr=true"
     - "--v=10"
       ports:
     - containerPort: 8443
       name: https
          - name: manager
            args:
     - "--metrics-addr=127.0.0.1:8080"
     - "--enable-leader-election"
     - "--leader-election-id=flask-operator"
```

## Build and Push Operator Image ## 

Now build your operator image and push it to your quay.io repository. Remember to replace <username> with your own username.

```execute
sudo make docker-build docker-push IMG=quay.io/<username>/flask-operator-2:v0.0.1
```

After pushing your image to quay.io you need to edit the config/manager/manager.yaml file and change the image field to reflect your image repository.

```execute
vi config/manager/manager.yaml
```

```
spec:
      serviceAccountName: flask-operator
      containers:
        - name: manager
          args:
            - "--enable-leader-election"
            - "--leader-election-id=flask-operator"
            image: quay.io/<username>/flask-operator-2:v0.0.1
          imagePullPolicy: "Always"

```

Now you can move forward for `Creating Metadata Bundle`
